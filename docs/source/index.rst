Timeseries Compute Documentation
====================================

Welcome to the **Timeseries Compute** project documentation!  
This project is a pet project for recreating a thesis in Python, focusing on time series modeling using ARIMA and GARCH models for financial data analysis, volatility forecasting, and market spillover effects.

Project Overview
----------------

Timeseries Compute provides tools for:

* Synthetic time series data generation with controlled properties
* Data preprocessing and transformation for time series analysis
* ARIMA modeling for conditional mean forecasting
* GARCH modeling for volatility forecasting
* Multivariate GARCH for correlation analysis
* Market spillover effects analysis
